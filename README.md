Familiarizing myself with the React library

Refer to [Next.js's React Foundations course](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations) for more details.

## Concepts of React

- Components: Building blocks of the user interface. They can be defined and reused as necessary. Think of it as a `Widget` from Flutter-verse.
- Props: Properties/parameters that can be passed to a single component instance for defining how the rendered component looks like. Think of it as `Widget` parameters. They may or may not be used to define the "initial state" of the component.
- State: The representation of any information that is rendered on the UI and that can change with time. It gives interactivity to components. Think of it as any (set of) variables that a `StatefulWidget` would maintain as part of its state.
